+Game Concept:
+
+Player controls a small prism that moves left and right.
+
+Colored objects fall from the top of the screen.
+
+The prism must match its color with the falling object to catch it.
+
+Catching the wrong color immediately ends the game.
+
+The game should be fun and accessible for all ages.
+
+Gameplay Mechanics:
+
+Controls: Use arrow keys (left/right) or on-screen buttons for movement.
+

+
+High Score: Keep track of the highest score in the session.
+
+Difficulty: Falling objects start slow and speed up gradually over time.
+
+Win/Lose Conditions:
+
+Game ends immediately on catching the wrong color.
+
+Optionally, display a “Game Over” screen with score and restart button.
+
+Visual Feedback:
+
+Smooth, colorful animations for prism and falling objects.
+
+Flash or shake effect on wrong catch.
+
+Display score and high score prominently.

+player controls a small prism at the bottom of the screen.
+
+The prism can move left and right using arrow keys or on-screen buttons.
+
+The prism can change color (if applicable for advanced levels/power-ups).
+
+Objective:
+
+Colored objects fall from the top of the screen.
+
+The player must catch objects that match the prism’s color.
+
+Catching a matching object increases the player’s score by 1.
+
+Catching a wrong color immediately ends the game.
+
+Game Progression:
+
+Objects start falling slowly and increase speed over time.
+
+The game may introduce more colors or multiple falling objects simultaneously to increase difficulty.
+
+Optional: power-ups may appear occasionally to help the player (e.g., slow down objects, auto-match prism color, bonus points).
+
+Scoring & Feedback:
+
+Display the current score and high score clearly on screen.
+
+Provide visual feedback (flash, shake, or particle effect) when catching an object correctly or incorrectly.
+
+Optional: play a short sound for correct catch and a different one for wrong catch.
+
+Instructions for the Player:
+
+Move the prism left/right to align with the falling colored objects.
+
+Match your prism’s color with the falling object.
+
+Avoid catching the wrong color.
+
+Try to get the highest score before a mistake ends the game.
+
+UI & Clarity:
+
+Show instructions clearly at the top or on a start screen.
+
+Display score, high score, and speed/difficulty level.
+
+Include a restart option after game over.
+
+Output Requirements for AI:
+
+Provide all of the above in a structured, clear format for implementing in a web game.
+
+Use simple, intuitive language that can be translated directly into HTML/CSS/JS mechanics.
