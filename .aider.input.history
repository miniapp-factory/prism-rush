+Game Concept:
+
+Player controls a small prism that moves left and right.
+
+Colored objects fall from the top of the screen.
+
+The prism must match its color with the falling object to catch it.
+
+Catching the wrong color immediately ends the game.
+
+The game should be fun and accessible for all ages.
+
+Gameplay Mechanics:
+
+Controls: Use arrow keys (left/right) or on-screen buttons for movement.
+
+Scoring: Each correct catch adds 1 point.
+
+High Score: Keep track of the highest score in the session.
+
+Difficulty: Falling objects start slow and speed up gradually over time.
+
+Win/Lose Conditions:
+
+Game ends immediately on catching the wrong color.
+
+Optionally, display a “Game Over” screen with score and restart button.
+
+Visual Feedback:
+
+Smooth, colorful animations for prism and falling objects.
+
+Flash or shake effect on wrong catch.
+
+Display score and high score prominently.
+
+Instructions: Display clear, concise instructions on the screen at the start.
+
+Audio Feedback: Include simple beep or chime sounds for correct catches and errors (optional).
+
+Code Requirements:
+
+Entire game must be fully functional in one HTML file.
+
+Use clean, well-commented code so it’s easy to understand.
+
+Optimize for performance — game should run smoothly in any modern browser.
+
+All shapes/colors must be generated using CSS, canvas, or inline drawing — no images.
+
+Output:
+
+Provide the full HTML code of the working game.
+
+Do NOT include explanations or extra text — only the final HTML file.
+
+The game must be immediately playable when opened in a browser.”**

+player controls a small prism at the bottom of the screen.
+
+The prism can move left and right using arrow keys or on-screen buttons.
+
+The prism can change color (if applicable for advanced levels/power-ups).
+
+Objective:
+
+Colored objects fall from the top of the screen.
+
+The player must catch objects that match the prism’s color.
+
+Catching a matching object increases the player’s score by 1.
+
+Catching a wrong color immediately ends the game.
+
+Game Progression:
+
+Objects start falling slowly and increase speed over time.
+
+The game may introduce more colors or multiple falling objects simultaneously to increase difficulty.
+
+Optional: power-ups may appear occasionally to help the player (e.g., slow down objects, auto-match prism color, bonus points).
+
+Scoring & Feedback:
+
+Display the current score and high score clearly on screen.
+
+Provide visual feedback (flash, shake, or particle effect) when catching an object correctly or incorrectly.
+
+Optional: play a short sound for correct catch and a different one for wrong catch.
+
+Instructions for the Player:
+
+Move the prism left/right to align with the falling colored objects.
+
+Match your prism’s color with the falling object.
+
+Avoid catching the wrong color.
+
+Try to get the highest score before a mistake ends the game.
+
+UI & Clarity:
+
+Show instructions clearly at the top or on a start screen.
+
+Display score, high score, and speed/difficulty level.
+
+Include a restart option after game over.
+
+Output Requirements for AI:
+
+Provide all of the above in a structured, clear format for implementing in a web game.
+
+Use simple, intuitive language that can be translated directly into HTML/CSS/JS mechanics.

+You are a professional web game developer. Create a fully playable browser game called "Prism Rush" that runs entirely in a single HTML file. Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no external libraries, images, or internet access. All graphics must use shapes, colors, or canvas drawing.
+
+Game Mechanics:
+- Player controls a small prism using left/right arrow keys or on-screen buttons.
+- Colored objects fall from the top of the screen.
+- The player must catch objects that match the prism's current color.
+- Catching a matching color increases the score by 1.
+- Catching a wrong color immediately ends the game.
+- Difficulty increases gradually (faster objects, multiple colors, more simultaneous objects).
+- Optional: occasionally spawn power-ups (slow motion, auto-match, bonus points).
+
+Gameplay Instructions:
+- Start screen displays game instructions clearly.
+- Real-time score and high score shown during gameplay.
+- Include Start, Pause/Resume, and Restart buttons.
+- Game-over screen with score summary and restart option.
+- Visual feedback for correct/incorrect catches (e.g., flash, shake, particles).
+- Controls must be intuitive and responsive.
+
+Design & UX Rules:
+- Keep visuals simple, colorful, and smooth.
+- Use only basic web components (canvas, divs, buttons, dialogs).
+- Instructions and UI must be concise and easy to understand.
+- Avoid unnecessary features and external dependencies.
+- Make the game bug-free, immediately playable in any modern browser.
+
+Output Requirements:
+- Provide a single HTML file containing the entire game.
+- Include clear, descriptive comments in the code for each section.
+- Ensure the game is self-contained and fully functional.
+- Focus on reliability and potential Web3 integration later.
+
+Extra Credit (Optional):
+- Include multiple prism colors, progressive levels, mini-challenges for engagement.
+- Include animations for catching objects and game-over effects.
+
+Important Do’s & Don’ts:
+- Do: Keep mechanics focused, engaging, and replayable.
+- Do: Ensure controls are smooth and responsive.
+- Don’t: Use external libraries, images, or internet-based assets.
+- Don’t: Include unnecessary features that distract from core gameplay.
+
+Your task: Generate the full, ready-to-play HTML file for Prism Rush, fully commented, bug-free, and optimized for all ages and grading criteria. Include instructions, scoring, UI, and gameplay mechanics exactly as described.
